# Image-Classification-using-Unsupervised-Learning
An Image Classifier implemented using deep learning libraries like Python Imaging Library, Open CV, TensorFlow etc.

# Image Loading
Image is loaded using four different methods : 
  1) IPython.display
  2) Tensorflow.Keras API - Preprocessing
  3) Open CV
  4) Python Imaging Library
  
# Loading the Deep Learning Model
The deep learning model is loaded using two methods : 
  1) MobileNet
  2) MobileNetV2
  
# Image Pre-processing
Image is pre-processed using :
  Tensorflow.Keras API - Preprocessing
  
# Predictions
Predictions are carried out and the results are printed explicitly.
